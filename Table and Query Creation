This file shows the first time I was challenge with generating my own table data, and then running queries on it.

/* Create table about the people and what they do here */
CREATE TABLE celebrities (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    fullname TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    job TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO celebrities (fullname, age, job) VALUES ("Taylor Swift","30","Singer");
INSERT INTO celebrities (fullname, age, job) VALUES ("Travis Kelce", "34", "Athlete");
INSERT INTO celebrities (fullname, job) VALUES ("Sarah J Maas", "Author");


CREATE TABLE hobbies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    hobby TEXT,
    experience_level INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO hobbies (hobby, experience_level) VALUES ("Rock Climbing","Expert");
INSERT INTO hobbies (hobby, experience_level) VALUES ("Rowing","Intermediate");
INSERT INTO hobbies (hobby, experience_level) VALUES ("Fishing","Beginner");



SELECT *
FROM celebrities;

SELECT*
FROM hobbies;

SELECT *
FROM celebrities
JOIN hobbies
ON celebrities.id=hobbies.id
